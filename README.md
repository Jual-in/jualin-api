# Rest API Jual.In

<div align="left">

The jual.in REST API is developed for the jual.in application, which is used to store and manage user data, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), products, and services available on the platform. This API is designed with RESTful principles to ensure good interoperability between system components. The main features of this API include user data management, including registration, login, and user profile management. Additionally, the API also supports the management of SME profiles, including business information, business categories, and geographic locations. Catalog management for products and services is also provided, including creation, deletion, and updating of product and service entries. This API also has secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Application developers for jual.in can leverage all these features to easily build and integrate applications.
